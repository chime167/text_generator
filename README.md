**ABOUT**

This is a text generator that accepts text files, such as a book, movie 
transcript, or any other collection of text, and generates ten sentences based on the
text provided. It utilizes a Markov chain model to generate unique sentences based on
the context surrounding each word/phrase in the provided text. Provided in this
repository is a corpus text file containing the Game of Thrones script, as well as the
script to Dreamwork's A Bee Movie, to test the program out


**USE**

After downloading the Python script, execute it with a file argument containing the
text you want to generate sentences on.


**REQUIREMENTS**

This script uses the NLTK Python library, so please make sure that is installed via pip.
Optionally, you can install PyPy, the JIT compiler version of Python, as it runs this
program slightly faster. Besides that, all you need is a text file.
